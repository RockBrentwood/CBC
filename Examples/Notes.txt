These were the problems brought up by porting your programs over to C-BC. It didn't take more than a few minutes to fix them all.

Major points of incompatibility with GNU-BC:
* <- used in place of "print". I changed them all.

* "log" and "number" are keywords in C-BC. They were used in a couple places in the programs. I changed "log" to "log_b" and "number" to "num"

* Numerous points where procedures are used before being declared or defined. In most places, either moving the definition up in front of its first use fixes the problem. Otherwise, issuing a forward declaration will fix the problem.

  The include statement can be used to include supporting files when routines are defined externally.

Other places where problems existed:
* Embedded strings have size limits. I fixed this by breaking off every few lines with quotes.

* Lengthy series of in-procedure assignment statements cause "program too complex". This wasn't fixed. I fixed it by rewriting this part of the program to read in the array data from a file.
